# Calculator-App
i I created this cool calculator app as part of my Andella assignment for week 6.
It is a simple yet powerful calculator built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Features

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
String multiple operations together (e.g., 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = 42)
Decimal point support for floating-point numbers
Clear button to start fresh

# How to use

Click on the number buttons to input the desired numbers.
Use the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.
Press the "=" key to get the result of the calculation.
Click on the "AC" button to clear the calculator and start over.
The "DEL" button can be used to delete the last entered digit.
